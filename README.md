# sql-challenge

In this project, I designed tables to hold employee data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. 

#### Data Modeling

I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

#### Data Engineering

I used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files., specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Then, I imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

#### Data Analysis

Then, I completed a list of queries about the data utilizing select statements and joins. 

#### Visualization

First, I imported the SQL database into Pandas. Then, I created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees. Finally, I created a bar chart of average salary by title.
